## Summary (informal)
Let $g_3(n)$ be the maximum size of a set $A\subseteq\{1,\dots,n\}$ such that every integer $m$ has at most two representations
$$m=ab,\qquad a<b,\ a,b\in A.$$

We give an explicit construction proving that 

$$g_3(n)\ge \frac{n\log\log n}{\log n} + (M+1+o(1))\frac{n}{\log n}.$$

In particular, this rules out any conjectural asymptotic of the form
$$g_3(n)=\frac{n\log\log n}{\log n} + (c+o(1))\frac{n}{(\log n)^2}.$$

We also summarize known/progress upper bounds for $g_3(n)$, and propose a revised formulation of the main question consistent with the above lower bound.
